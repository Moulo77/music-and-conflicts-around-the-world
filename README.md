# World Sound Map: Musical Styles and Global Conflicts

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an interactive world map that showcases the dominant musical styles in different regions over time. Additionally, the map will overlay global conflicts (wars, genocides, social movements) to explore possible correlations between external events and the evolution or creation of musical styles.

## Step 1: Mapping Dominant Musical Styles

### Data Sources:

### Visualization:
- An **interactive world map** where each region (country or continent) is linked to a dominant musical style.
- A **timeline slider** to allow users to go back in time and see the evolution of musical genres decade by decade.
- **Heatmaps** to show the concentration of dominant musical styles in specific areas.
- Indicate emerging musical genres or those influenced by social movements.

## Step 2: Overlaying Global Conflicts

### Data Sources:

### Visualization:
- **Interactive world map** to represent wars, genocides, and social movements.
- A **timeline** showing the intensity of conflicts in certain regions over different decades.

---

## Correlation Analysis
- Explore potential correlations between global conflicts and the emergence or transformation of musical styles in specific regions.
- Use **graphs** to visualize periods of conflict intensity and peaks in music production or popularity in affected areas.

## Conclusion
This project combines music, geography, and history to reveal interesting patterns between the evolution of musical genres and major historical events. By visualizing both music and conflicts on a global scale, I aim to uncover the connections between cultural expressions and external societal pressures.
